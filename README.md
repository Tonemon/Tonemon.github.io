# Tonemon's Workspace (Tonemon.github.io)
- Welcome to my personal Github homepage where (almost) all my projects are hosted online and displayed. You can visit my homepage by clicking <a href="http://tonemon.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>. Some of these projects are different and can vary in language and purpose.

## How Versions are used:
I have made my own version control system which I have been using to name the new features, bug fixes and new releases for almost all of my project. It's explained below:
<ul>
<li>Version 1 (First number) = General Release number (also used when the project is rewritten from scratch).</li>
<li>Version 1.1 (Second number) = Indicates Big updates like: multiple pages updated, new features etc. </li>
<li>Version 1.1.1 (Third number) = Indicates Small updates like minor bug fixes etc. </li>
</ul>
